        <p>THURSDAY, DECEMBER 14, 1905.</p>
        <p>CORPORATION OF WESTERN EGYPT.</p>
        <p>A great deal of interest has been taken in Egypt since the last Anglo-French agreement removed many of the fears that prevented investors from exploiting the country to the full extent of its possibilities, and several important undertakings have been launched during the past eighteen months, chiefly for the purpose of acquiring land and other real estate concessions. The first annual statements of these ventures are now beginning to appear, and erstwhile we noted the publication of the initial report of the Egyptian Delta Land and Investment Company. Last week was issued the first report of the Corporation of Western Egypt, a concern which was floated early this year, and holds concessions entitling it, amongst other things, to take up during the course of the next three decades some 600,000 feddans of land (a feddan being roughly an acre) in the cases of Khargs, Dakhla, Farafra and Baharia. The report covers the period to 30th September last, and shows that the Corporation is in a very strong financial position. Of its £500,000 capital about £250,000 has been subscribed and £215,600 paid up, the final call of 5s. per share having been postponed because the Directors already possess for the time being sufficient money for working purposes. Although over £110,000 has been spent on preliminary operations, plant, etc., £98,000 is still in hand, either in the shape of cash or easily realised firstclass securities. The particulars given in the report make a good showing as a return for the expenditures so far incurred. Kharga and the other oases mentioned will not be familiar names to the majority of people, and it will suffice to say that they represent a territory of about £74,000 square miles, inhabited by a population of about 30,000 : that they lie about 300 miles from Cairo, off the Nile valley, and that by a branch line now in course of construction and joining the State Railways at Farshut, they will be brought into direct communication with the capital. A detailed survey of a considerable portion of Central Kharga has been made during the past season, and the cultivable areas of some x00 square kilometrees have been determined and mapped out. The whole of the railway route has been surveyed, and, as already stated, the construction of the line has commenced, and even the contracts have been placed for the rolling stock. One of the most satisfactory results of the development work is that which has determined the adequacy of the water supply, a point of primary importance in a venture of this kind in such a country as Egypt. Boring operations both on the Kharga and Dakhla oases have demonstrated a full artesian supply, and have satisfied the corporation's local manager and geological expert that the yield is practically inexhaustible. That the supply must be of extraordinary permanence is proved by the fact that old wells sunk by the Romans and ancient Egyptians, when reopened, still pour out over 500 gallons a minute.</p>
        <p>Given a good water supply for irrigation, the successful development of the land is practically assured, other things being equal. This development has naturally had a chief claim on the attention of the Directors, and it is to promote it that communication is being established as rapidly as possible with the State Railways. This connection will not only assist in the exploitation of the oases, but must necessarily thereby be a determining factor in the value of the land. The worth of land is rising throughout Egypt generally, as Land Cromer had occasion to point out in his last report ; and thought the Directors have already had applications for claims they are waiting to see what effect the completion of the first section of the railway will have in increasing the value of their estates before striking an approximate maximum price for purchasers. The Directors state that on present data they think £20 per feddan ought to be obtained in the neighborhood of the line and £10 per feddan in the more remote districts. Taking an average of only £12 10s per feddan for the 20,000 feddans the corporation is entitled to exploit per annum, the gross revenue from this source alone would be £250,000. The land is of loamy clay, similar to that already cultivated and yielding excellent crops of cereals, dates, etc. ; but the corporation's experts are making an exhaustive study of the local conditions to determine whether cotton and other staples can also be profitably grown. The land business, however, great as it is, is by no means the only interest of the corporation. Its concessions carry mineral and other rights, and their exploitation, it is hoped, will contribute to the general success of the undertaking. At present, for obvious reasons, attention to this side of the corporation's prospects has been rather restricted in scope, but enough has been accomplished to show that the mineral possibilities are far from unpromising. An expert who has been examining the earthy minerals, such as alum, ochres and salts of manganese and cobalt, states that, pending a full analysis, he has no hesitation in asserting that their potential value is commercially very great. Aluminous deposits of vast extent have already been disclosed at Kharga, and are to be worked for aluminium sulphate by a process of manufacture that can be undertaken by the natives alone. These particulars serve to show the large sphere of operations covered by the corporation, and if the rapid progress made during the present year be maintained, there should be much additional matter of interest for the shareholders in the next annual report.</p>

                    <head>GOLD IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <head>THE RECENT IMPORTANT FINDS.</head>
                    <p>The recent discovery of gold in the western oases is of the first importance not only to the interests of the Corporation of Western Egypt but to the general development of the mining industry of the country. It affords a first indication of the actual direction in which the gold has drifted that must have been eroded from the eastern hills daring vast geological periods before man appeared in the Nile Valley, and also of the probable manner of its deposition.</p>
                    <p>So far as the immediate interests of the Corporation are concerned,2 dwts. per ton may not seem, at first sight, to be very important; but it is to be remembered that the gold is contained in pyrites which form generally more than one-tenth of the phosphate rook. This rook must in any case be powdered to be commercially useful, and when this is done the pyrites can be separated with very little expense, while the richness and commercial value of the phosphates are greatly enhanced by its removal.</p>
                    <p>The separated pyrites should then carry from half an ounce to an ounce per ton. and will be valuable as a source of sulphur and sulphuric acid, in addition to yielding this amount of gold. It will also be necessary to enquire what has become of the gold that has weathered out of the extensive phosphate outcrops  since the oases were first formed or since their formation commenced.</p>
                    <p>It is impossible to say at present exactly where it may be found, but it is at least permissible  to hope that it is held within the oases area. Another point to be considered is what indication this discovery may give to aid in tracing and discovering the “deep leads” which very possibly exist between the gold belts of the Eastern hills and the oases. The discovery of such leads would give a new impulse to Egyptian mining, and might result in most important developments.</p>

                    <p>The above works are the result of 8ir Benjamin Baker's visit last season. Whenhe visited the work last winter, he recommended extensive protective works on the talus downstream of the dam, where the severe action of the water through he sluices had eroded even the sound granite. The P. W. D. had recognised the necessity of these protective works and had already commenced them, and had in 1901 completed the repairs of certain of the worst places, and were intending to spend a further sum of L.E 50,000 in 1905. Sir Benjamin, however, recommended protective works upon a still larger scale than this, which will involve an expenditure of something like a quarter of a million of money, and take two years to complete.</p>

                    <head>ACTION OF AUTHORITIES.</head>
                    <p>Yesterday no incident occurred at Alexandria to disturb public security, but the state of mind of a large portion of the European population is by no means tranquil. As an example of this feeling of insecurity we may instance the run on the shops of the gunsmiths yesterday. The police authorities thought that yesterday the panic had to all appearances so much subsided that it would be permissible to allow the gunsmiths' establishments to be reopened. But as soon as the decision of the authorities became known, there was a great rush to buy arms on the part of Europeans and a big trade was done in revolvers end other weapons. The authorities decided therefore to again order the closing of these shops, and this morning all of the gunsmiths were shut up and will remain so until further notice.</p>
                    <p>The police authorities ere quite satisfied that the attitude of the natives is peaceful, and they are in fact quite cowed. But the authorities state that they are afraid of the Europeans in their present excited state, and believe that if there is any renewal of the disturbance it will be provoked by the Europeans.</p>
                    <p>Morice Bey, Inspector of the Parquet at the Ministry of Justice, has arrived from Cairo in connection with the forthcoming trials of the persons accused of having taken part in the riot on Sunday afternoon.</p>
                    <p>Up to now no death has occurred among the Europeans and natives injured in the disorders. Mr. Marsden, the sub-manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, is recovering from his wound, and will in all probability be able to resume his duties next week.</p>
                    <p>CONVOCATION OF SHEIKHS.</p>
                    <p>This morning and yesterday afternoon there were two important meetings of all the religious sheikha, who are accustomed to preach in the mosques at Alexandria. These meetings were convened by the order of Mahmoud Pasha 8idky, Governor of Alexandria, and all who were summoned attended. The Governor addressed the sheikhs on the subject of the recent disturbance and laid strict injunctions upon them all to use their best endeavours in their religious addresses to impress upon their hearers the need for calmness, as unless the populace preserved its self-control public security would again be disturbed. His Excellency's earnest exhortations had a great effect on his audience and all the sheikhs present this morning and at yesterday's meeting promised the Governor that they would be untiring in their efforts to use their religious influence in the interests of public tranquillity.</p>
                    <p>EUROPEAN CLERICAL INFLUENCE</p>
                    <p>His Holiness Photius, the Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Alexandria, has informed the Governor that he will in his sermon on Sunday next dwell upon the necessity of peace and harmony between the Orthodox Greek population and the natives. His Holiness has also enjoined the Orthodox clergy throughout Alexandria , to endeavour to pacify any excitement  among members of their congregations.</p>
                    <p>The Latin Archbishop of Alexandria has also undertaken to use his influence in the same direction.</p>
                    <p>FEARS FOR THE FUTURE.</p>
                    <p>Nervous people have been considerably alarmed by the very widespread rumours as to a forthcoming renewal of the disturbance which it is alleged has been timed to take place on Sunday next But the authorities are fully prepared for any such renewal of the troubles and all precautions have been taken to prevent any disorders again breaking out so there is not the slightest need for any alarm.</p>
                    <p>TELEGRAM FROM MUSTAPHA PASHA KAMEL</p>
                    <p>The following telegram was received by us yesterday, too late for inclusion in our issue of that day:--</p>
                    <p>Please read what I have written in the "Reforme" yesterday, so that yon may know that I had always preached the harmony of the.Eyptians and the Europeans residents, and that the accusing of the Egyptians and the leaders of the public opinion in Egypt with fanatism is an absurd thing which promotes discord and dissension. I believe that the difference in political opinions does not tend to instigate the holders of such opinions to accuse themselves injustly. I see that the interest of my country lies in the preservance of peace and tranquillity. No one can say that I have said or done the reverse. I affected that you will turn a deaf ear to the fabricated and alarming reports promoted by the alarmists for personal prejudices and especial designs and to interpret with great care what is published in the Mohamedan newspapers about the Macedonian crisis before giving any decision about their attitude. Had you done so you would have seen that the "Al Lewa” is the mildest and most of all in exerting efforts to cultivate agreement between the different nationalities in Egypt I am much astonished for yon have not written any blaming word to the foreign rabbles who were the cause of the Alexandrian disturbance. I believe that the only remedy to such inconveniences is the allowing the Mixed Tribunals to settle criminal cases committed by or against the foreigners for it is the only thing which preserves the public security,—Mustapha Kamel Pasha.</p>

                    <head>LAST SUNDAY'S RIOT.</head>
                    <head>CORRESPONDENT’S VIEWS</head>
                    <p>A well-known resident at Alexandria writes:—I would express the view, if you will kindly permit me to do so through you, that it would be safer not to belittle last Sunday’s disturbances. It is quite possible that had your paper been rather more of an alarmist, you might have moved the authorities to have been bettor prepared, and that, as a  consequence, last Sunday’s riot would have been suppressed with such promptitude and energy as to have justified you in assuring the public now that no repetition of such recurrences need be feared. As it is, rumour has it, in spite of everything that the papers say, that next Sunday is to be the witness of a far more grave state of things than last Sunday was, and this is repeated with such assurance by so many months that many people are becoming seriously alarmed. Of what use is it to be satisfied to merely state that there is no farther occasion for alarm and to make other such like statements, as the papers are now doing. These statements do not reassure people in the least, they are simply a repeti tion of those made in 1882. What people want to know is what precautions are being taken by the authorities against a repetition of Sunday’s disturbances. They want to see there mentioned by newspapers, such as your own, after due enquiry has been made. They want to learn if it is. intended to deal severely and promptly with all disturbers' of the peace, and, if so, they want such intentions to be made generally known. They want to know if such enquiries are being made as to the original cause of last Sunday’s rioting as will lead to the detection of the persons responsible for the feeling which caused a mere gambling quarrel to assume the proportions it did. They want aall this to be mads generally known in order not only to judge if tranquillity has really been assured for the present, but to serve as a lesson to persons interested in creating discord and riot that their acts, however carefully hidden, will be certainly traced and brought home to them with the utmost severity.</p>
                    <p>The foregoing, I venture to submit, will do more to allay toe fears of nervous people than mere assurance and pooh-poohing the gravity of what has taken place. It is quite correct to reassure our visitors the tourists, but residents who are in continual touch with the natives' and know what is really going on also require some consideration, and mere state menu that all is now quiet will hardly satisfy them. The natives themselves, those who desire law and order, require to be reassured also ; they are far from being so at present Many of my native friends openly tell me they are much afraid of farther disturbances business is also affected by the present state of things. As to the villages, I fear that unless the authorities show a firm hand and the intention to use most severe measures there may be trouble there also.</p>

                    <head>THE CAPITULATIONS.</head>
                    <p>The disturbance on Sunday has led to a discussion of the part the Capitulations played as a secondary cause.</p>
                    <p>"Al Moayad" is of opinion that the Capitula-tions are greatly to be blamed for the outbreak at Alexandria, and it urges the Government to prevent Europeans from carrying arms.</p>
                    <p>"Al Abram" says that the English want to use the disturbance as a lever to obtain more power than before, and both "Al Lewa” and "Al Ahram” claim that the Mixed Courts should be made competent in the case of European criminals. His view is opposed to that of Lord Cromer, who states in his last Report that "‘The proposal to transfer criminal jurisdiction over Europeans from the consular to the Mixed Courts is not one which the British Government could, under present circumstances , view with favor, nor one which they could advise the Egyptian Government to accept."</p>

                    <p>The directors-ofthe Khedivial Mail Steam ship and Graving Dock Company, Limited, will present a very satisfactory report at the -eighth ordinary general meeting of the share- holders which is to he held to-morrow at Winchester House, Old Broad Street, London, EC.</p>
                    <p>The statement of accounts for the year ending 30th of June last is as follows:--The trading profit for the year, including  Government subsidies, and after charging insurance of steamers, all salaries, office and general expenses, has amounted to 76,985,17.7, to which is added for transfer fees £2,12.6, making together £76,988.10.2. From which is deducted :
                        D benture interest, depreciation, directors’ and auditors' remuneration, £18,875.10.0, leaving a balance of £58,113.0.1. The balance brought forward from the previous year is £2,228.18.6, making a total of £60,841.18.7. Of this sum dividends have been paid on the Preference shares for two-and-a half years to 31st December , 1904, amounting to £37,491.9.6, leaving a balance of £32,850.9.1. A farther dividend on Preference shares for the half-year ending 30th June last was paid on September 30th, amounting to £ 1,497.16.0, leaving a balance available for appropriation of £27,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors now recommend the payment of a dividend at the rate of 10 per cent, on the Ordinary shares, payable on December 31st, which would absorb £10,000.0.0, leaving a balance to be carried forward to next account of £17,352.13.1.</p>
                    <p>The directors are pleased to report that doting the past year the vessels have been well kept up. They have run free from any serious accidents, and all services have been regularly maintained.</p>
                    <p>Owing to the increased volume of business the directors have contracted with Messrs. Swan, Hunter and Wigham Richardson, Limited, for a new passenger steamer, with all modern improvements, and calculated to maintain speed of from 17 to 18 knots at sea. The directors hope that the new vessel will be a profitable acquisition to the company's fleet, She is to be finished and delivered in July next. Since the close of last year, two vessels, the Keneh, of 1,581 tons, and the Kosseir, of 1,851. tons, have been purchased and added to the company’s fleet.</p>
                    <p>To meet the requirements of the Egyptian authorities, a regular direct service has been established between Suez and Suakin in connection with the new railway, Suakin to Khartoum. Under an agreement with the Egyptian Government a subsidy of £5,000 per annum (for five years) will be paid to the company in consideration of its services in regard to this line.</p>

                    <p>It is always difficult for a single artist to hold the attention of his audience throughout the programme, and M. Pierre Loredan has to be congratulated on the very excellent recital he gave at the Savoy yesterday afternoon. It is only to be regretted that his concert  had not been more widely advertised, for though he early claimed the sympathies of his audience the hall was never really full. M. Pierre Loredan plays with much taste and subtle feeling, and his execution is excellent. He gave a very fine rendering of Mendelssohn's "Rondo capriccioso,” and Chopin’s "Beroeuse” was a delightful achievement. His "Il Tremolo,” by Gottsohalk, was excellent is every way, his phrasing of the highest order. Perhaps it was the length of the performance or a slight want of sympathy that prevented his doing full justice to Raff's "Fileuse,” for his rendering of that delicate "Gazouillement du printemps” by Sinding had been particularly graceful and happy.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTOLOGICAL NOTES.
                        M. CAPART'S WORK.</head>
                    <p>The second volume of the magnificent work "Recueil de Monumnets Egyptiens," of Monsieur Jean Capart, conservator of the Egyptian Museum in Brussels, containing a further fifty heliogravare reproductions of Egyptian antiquities, has just been published by M. Vromant. The monuments selected for this series are fully as important and interesting as those of the first volume, the photographs are as carefully prepared, and the accompanying dissertation upon each precisely what is adequate. This time almost every hieroglyphic text upon the objects is fully set forth in the essay referring to it, and generally translated, so that the work is useful for students of Egypt as well as for the history of Egyptian art.</p>
                    <p>As with the previous subjects selected, these are from collections generally not in the large museums of European Capitals but in less visited places, and many of the new plates reproduce relics at Athens, Brussels, Marseilles, and University College, London. As far as convenient the chronological order is followed in the arrangement of the plates, the series commencing with the 4th dynasty and terminating with a Byzantine tapestry. In reviewing such a valuable work it is difficult to decide upon which of the heliogravures to especially comment upon, but there are a certain number of them which to an Egyptologist are peculiarly noteworthy. Of these plate 55, giving a statue of marvellously fine workmanship yet dating as early perhaps as the 5th dynasty, is specially interesting. The features are well preserved and the head surmounted with a peculiar perruque, or wig, the plaits of which in front are short, ending in the crown of the cranium, fresh ones commencing there and falling down at the back to the neck. The waist cloth is pleeted upon the right side of the body only. The pose of the body is precisely that of the familiar later type of Egyptian human statues, but the porportions of the figure are those of adolescence, the arms and legs being  thin and the general attitude not so rigid.</p>
                    <p>Plate 59 is a photograph of the Sphinx with human head, now in Louvre, and supposed to have come from Tarsis. Although the head is somewhat mutilated sufficient of the facial carving remains to show that it is of similar physiognomy to the other celebrated Sphinx from the same site which in an inscription upon it bore the name of Apepi, the Hyksos, or Shepherd king. It was upon the features of this second human-headed Sphinx that many theories of the ethnic affinities of the Hyksos were founded, until a Russian Egyptologist, M. Golenischoff, proved that not only was the Apepi text not the only one upon the statue, for it bore the name of Pisebkhenon of the 21st dynasty and that the latter's cartouche had been graven over an erasure of some other Pharaoh's name, but that the king whose features it originally represented was <persName>Amenemhat III</persName>., inscribed with his name, at St. Petersburg, and of another similar statuette evidently of the same personage, but without any inscription. The proof of identity and date of production of the personage and monument, is not only derived from the visage, but from the peculiar rayed headdress and also ibbed, or striated shoulder covering. The Louvre sphinx bears texts of Rameses II., and his son, Menepthas, inscribed over erasures of those of previous owners. Nothing in Egyptian royal manners was, unfortunately, more de rigeur than to remove the record of a previous Pharaoh from some valuable monument and substitute another.</p>
                    <p>The Hyksos king may not have been the culprit in the case of the best preserved of the Tanis sphinxes who thus wronged Amenemhat, but the deed may have been done by orders of Pisebkhenon, whose cartouche placed upon the breast has usurped the site where the original text was carved. The Apepi name upon that sphinx is engraved on the shoulder, a Semitic practice alluded to in the phrase "the Government shall be upon his shoulders." If the Hyksos origin of these Tanis sphinxes and that of the similar typed specimen from Bubastis has to be abandoned, all the voluminous essays upon the racial connection of that mysterious people based upon them become worthless. The idea was apparently fortified by the town of Tarris, whence the earliest found sphinxes came, having been the Hyksos capital ; but other specimens, possessing similar peculiarities, have been discovered at Bubastis, and also up the Nile at El Kah, a site no Hyksos, save as a prisoner, ever saw, whilst it formed part of Amenemhat III's kingdom. Why the features of the 12th dynasty monarchy differed so much from those of other Egyptian sovereigns is as yet undetermined.</p>
                    <p>For the next subject M. Capart has selected a head in the Egyptian collection at University College, London, because it provides another portrait of Amenemhat II. Unfortunately, the nose is partly broken away. It, however, still remains a splendid specimen of Egyptian sculptures, and is perhaps the most important phototype in this volume. It of course presents the same type of rayed head dress, but in the case the remarkable arrangement of the rays in groups of three is very manifest. Herr Borchardt believes this design to be a peculiarity entirely of 12th dynasty Pharaonic statues and almost so of those solely of Amenemhat II. As we are unable to illustrate those notes by the head in question it will be well to quote. </p>

                    <head>THE SUEZ CANAL COLLISION.
                        CLAIM FOR DAMAGES.</head>
                    <p>The collision of the S.S. Chathan and its subsequent blowing up in the Suez Canal formed the subject of a claim by the owners of the vessel against the owners of the Clan Cumming before the president and the Trinity Masters in the Admiralty Court last week.</p>
                    <p>It appeared that on Sept. 5 of this year, shortly after seven p.m., the Chatham lay in the Suez Canal on a voyage from London and the Elbe to Bangkok and Yokohama, having on board a cargo which included 3600 cases of dynamite and sixteen cases of detonators. The vessel stood near the eastern bank, about a cable to the north of the tenth mile-post. The weather was fine and clear, with a light wind blowing and the Clan Cumming came easily along at about five miles an hour, bound for Port Said. As she approached the Chatham she opened her masthead and both side lights, and when the two vessels were about 1 1/2 mile distant from each other measures were taken for the purpose of tying up the Chathan to allow the Clan Cumming to pass. Engines were put to slow, dead slow, and then stopped. When from a quarter to half a mile away the defendant's vessel, so the plaintiffs allege, approached at a high rate of speed, and did not open her red light until a very short distance off. When collision seemed imminent she sounded three short blasts on the whistle, and immediately afterwards her stem struck the starboard bow of the Chatham. It was a violent blow, cutting right into the forecastle. The force of the collision cut down the bulkhead of the Chatham causing the lamp attached to it to fall and set fire to the contents of the forecastle. It became necessary to flood the forehold and submerge the vessel in order to prevent the fire spreading to the explosives on board. The Chatham was subsequently blown up by order of the Canal authorities. Plaintiffs alleged that the Clan Cumming was handled improperly, nd that a good look-out was not kept. They therefore claimed judgement against the defendants and their bail for the damage caused to the plaintiffs by reason of the collision ; also a reference to the Regustrar, assisted by merchants, to assess the amount of the damage. </p>
                    <p>The defence was that lights were burning brightly on the Clan Cumming, and a good look-out was also being kept. The egines were, on the approach, put at half-speed, slowed down, and then stopped. Almost immediately afterwards the engines of the Clan Cumming were put full-speed astern and three loud blasts were sounded on the whistle, but the Chatham, which was heard to let go her starboard anchor and to sound a blast, was seen to extinguish her lights, and although the port anchor of the Clan Cumming was let go and held on to, the Chatham, it was alleged, came on with considerable headway, and with her starboard bow struck the stem of the Clan Cumming, inflicting considerable damage. Defendants denied the allegations of improper handling, and counterclaimed against the plaintiffs for damages in respect of the collision.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Laing, K. C., Mr. Scrutton, K. C., and Mr. Dumas appeared for the plaintiffs ; and the defendants were represented by Mr. Pickford, K. C., Mr. Butler Aspinall, K. C., and Mr. Bullock.</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickford, answering his lordship, said the real point was on the question of speed. The rate at which the Chatham was travelling was, in his opinion, excessive, having regard to the regulations of the canal.</p>
                    <p>Sir Gorell Barnes : What do you say was the speed of the Clan Cumming?</p>
                    <p>Mr. Pickford : Regulation speed, of course.</p>
                    <p>Witnesses were being called for the plaintiffs when the Court adjourned.</p>

                    <head>EGYPTIAN LIGHT RAILWAYS.
                        REPORT OF INSPECTOR.</head>
                    <p>An interesting report on the working of light railways throughout Egypt during the past year has been made by Mr. Gunn, of the Railway Administration. We extract the following passages :--</p>
                    <p>There has been added to the lines only 97 kilometres in all and a section of 10 kilometres closed, making an actual increase of 17 kilometres for the year, giving a total of 1,107 kilometres for all three companies as compared with 1,090 for the previous year. 15 kilometres have been opened since the close of the companies' years by the Egyptian Delta Light Railway Co., and they are constructing several other sections.</p>
                    <p>The total receipts of the three systems amounted to L.E. 171,067 for the previous year. It will be seen by these figures that there is an increase of thirty-eight thousand and eleven Egyptian pounds (L.E. 38,011) of which sum L.E. 29,762 belong to the Egyptian Delta Light Railway Co.</p>
                    <p>The total number of passengers carried was over 5 3/4 millions (5,797,562), an increase over the previous year of over one million. Of this total the Delta Co. carried nearly 4 1/2 millions (4,478,403). Goods, 979,554 tons lifted, as against 642,969 for 1903, showing an increase of 327,585. This includes the transport of 195,195 tons of earth for reclaiming land by the Delta Co. While the kilometrage practically remains the same, the gross receipts show an increase on the total of L.E. 171,067 for 1903 equal to 22%. To this increase more than half is due to the passenger traffic, viz.: L.E. 9,113. While the cotton crop was good and contributed to the great increase over the last year, it is evident that a large factor has been the through-booking with the Government Railways. Shippers are beginning to find out that they can ship their goods to almost any part of the country while remaining themselves at home, and are availing themselves of it. It does not, however, seem to be generally known. I should like to call attention to the fact that it is highly desirable to have this system throughout ; it is not only profitable to the Light Railways, but also to the Government Railways, which receive the greater proportion of the receipts. The Light Railway Companies whose stations number in the neighborhood of 300 are anxious to open them all to through-booking. The Government stations number about 250. I would suggest that this matter should be taken up, and that special notices should be distributed. </p>
                    <p>The chief cause of complaint against the companies has been the irregularity of trains, and it can be partly accounted for by the wet and slippery state of the agricultural roads during the rainy season. This can hardly be avoided while the railways follow so closely the agricultural roads, where there is a great deal of traffic and the rails get covered with the sticky mud and retard the trains. However, a marked improvement can be noted over the previous year, chiefly due to better supervision, more powerful engines, and the increase of separate trains for goods on lines where traffic is heaviest. The separation of passengers and goods is the only satisfactory arrangement. If they are handled jointly one or the other must suffer.</p>

                    <p>The above teams met on Moharrem Bey common on Saturday last. This is the second meeting this season, the first game having guide to the "Dube" by 5 goals to 1. The Saints were rther under strength, but never theless the game was very evenly contested throughout, both defences having a lot to do. The "Dubs" were the first to score, the ball being rushed into the net by Leary after a misunderstanding between Davies and Curtis. Saints tried hard to eqalise before the close of the half and some good play by Constantinides brought the forwards well into the "Dubs" territory. Bright had hard lines in not scoring from a clearance by Nowland after the custodian had been hard pressed. All further attacks were repulsed and half-time arrived with the scores : D Co. 1 ; St Andrew nil.</p>
                    <p>The teams turned round without leaving the field and the second half opened briskly. The "Dubs" looked like increasing their lead from a brilliant individual effort by Coyne, who beat halves and backs alike, but with only Curtis to beat the shot over the bar. The Saints then got away on the right and Constantimidis took the ball well down, there placing to centre. Bright took it up and passed to Jones, who very smartly netted the ball. Being again on a level footing both teams tried their utmost to obtain the lead, but all efforts were fruitless and time arrived with the score one all. The following were the teams : --St. Andrew F.C.--Curtis, Hopkins, Davis, Mace, Cowie, Williams, Conatantinidis, Angel, Bright, Jones, and Tullock.</p>
