<head>THE NEW CABINET.</head>
<head>"GOOD AND CAPABLE.”</head>
<head>MR. BALFOUR INDISPOSED</head>
<p>(Gazette's Special Service).</p>
<p>London, Monday. Dec. 11.</p>
<p>The composition of the new Ministry is generally held in political circles to be a clever one, and especially good for election purposes. The presence of Sir Edward Grey, Lord Crewe, and Mr. Haldane will afford security of a programme of moderate and wise reform. Lord Rosebery has been quite isolated. The new Lord Chamberlain will be Earl Spencer's bro-ther, the Rt. Hon. R. C. Spencer, who will receive a peerage.</p>
<p>London, December 11</p>
<p>It is agreed on all sides that Sir Henry Campbell Bannerman has enlisted the Cabinet from the strongest members of the party, with the exception of Lord Rosebery. Even Unionists admit that it is good and capable.</p>
<p>The Ministers will hold the first meeting of the Cabinet in a few days in order to fix the date of the elections. Mr. Balfour is indisposed. His sleep is troubled by internal pains.</p>	<p>(Reuter)</p>
<p>London, December 11.</p>
<p>The new Ministers have all taken possession of their portfolios, Mr. George Whiteley has been appointed Chief Government Whip.</p> <p>(R.)</p>

<div>
<head>SPEECH BY LORD ROSEBERY.</head>
<p>London, December 11.</p>
<p>Presiding at the Council of the Liberal League, Lord Rosebery congratulated Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman upon having obtained the reward of strenuous hard work. He said that we might now expect financial economy and a strong, dignified foreign policy, and might hope to see an army once more. Nobody outside a lunatic asylum believed that Home Rule would be introduced during the next parliament. It was the duty of the Government to maintain the unity of the Free Trade parly, but they must be entirely independent of the Irish vote.</p> <p>(Reuter)</p>

<p>Charity Performance.</p>
<p>On Sunday afternoon a charitable entertainment was given at the College des Freres, Koronfish, Cairo, under the auspices of M. de la Bouliniere, who was received by the "Marseillaise” on his arrival. The chief feature of the afternoon's performance was a four act drama entitled Alaff, or Le Martyr de la Siberie, a drama versified by Frere Roland of the College and played with remarkable success by the pupils. The orchestra, staging, and decorations were all admirable, and we are not surprised to hear that charity has profited by the success of the entertain-ment.</p>

<div>
<head>MERCHANT SEAMEN'S HOME.</head>
<p>A concert of more than usual interest was given in the Merchant Seamen’s Home on Friday last. The piano secured by the exertions of the Woman’s Guild of St. Andrew’s Church was handed over and used for the first time. The presentation was to have been made by Mrs. Ross, of Gordon House the president of the Guild, but she was prevented from being present by a severe chill. Mr. Ross, however ably represented his wife, and congratulated the Woman’s Guild of the Church of Scotland upon the successful issue of their labours and the handsome appearance of the piano. Turning to the men he said that the ladies in every port had a warm heart towards the sailors, and as this piano would testify, Alexandria was no exception to the rule ; indeed the Guild of St Andrew’s Church had given a very substantial token of their regard for the sailors frequenting this port Calling upon Miss Swan to hand over the piano, he took the opportunity to express the hope that those who visited the Home would spend many happy nights in company with such a nice instrument. Miss Swan then formally handed over the piano in the name of the guild for use in the Seamen’s Home, and the Rev. Hugh P. Reid thanked her for the gift and hoped that there would be no discord but much harmony and enjoyment in the entertainments in which this instrument was to play a prominent part.
It was a substantial sign of the church's interest in the men. He thereafter called upon Mrs. Munro to “ hansel ” the piano, which she did with a very sweet solo. The usual concert succeeded, and it proved a most interesting and enjoyable one. An indication of the interest in the occasion was given by the numbers who simply packed the ball, and who expressed their appreciation of the fare provided in no uncertain way. The following ladies and gentlemen kindly gave their services Mrs. Munro, Mrs. Reid, Miss Davies Messrs. Byrne. Elliott Goodrich and Thom.</p>
<p>A vote of thanks to Mrs. Ross, who provided the tea, and to the artistes, brought a very pleasant evening to a close.</p>
<p>The piano is in polished oak, has a handsome appearance  and a rich mellow tone, and was provided by Messrs. Paterson and Sons, of Glasgow.</p>

<div>
<head>SUNDAYS DISTURBANCE.</head>
<head>PUBLIC FEELING REASSURED.</head>
<p>We are glad to state that there has been no repetition of Sunday's disturbances in Alexandria, and the state of public feeling is becoming somewhat reassured. Everything tends to show that the riot if it may so be characterised, was a purely spontaneous ebullition of feeling, just as was the Hamamil affair of a few years ago. when the natives made a sudden and great disturbance owing to the murder of an Egyptian policeman by a low-class Italian. If the Greek had not accidentally injured the Arab on Sunday no disturbance would have oocurred. This was the spark which, coming as it did amidst the existing state of apprehension, inflamed the passions of the populace and led to what was really nothing more serious than “a storm in a teacup.”</p>
<p>The state of public feeling throughout the city yesterday was still nervous, and last night a number of coffee-houses and tobacconists shops and other establishments, which are usually kept open until a late hour of the night were closed by 10 o'clock.</p>
<p>Last night the dangerous quarter of the Hamamil, where the worst part of the distur-bances took place on Sunday afternoon, was patrolled by a large number of police. There was no disturbance.</p>
</div>
<div>
<head>THE PROVINCES.</head>
<p>Cairo is reported to be quiet hot we regret to state-that matters in some of the provincial districts are not satisfactory, as the following statement from an Englishman, resident in the Behera province, in the neighbourhood of Damanhour, will prove. This correspondent gives us the following information :—</p>
<p>It is most sincerely to be hoped that the authorities will send strict injunctions to the moudirs to warn omdehs to pacify the people. The wildest rumours are current It is currently believed by the natives hereabouts that the Army of Occupation has been withdrawn and they believe that a great uprising is to take place by order of the Saltan. They read or have read to them the exaggerated stories in the Arabic papers which make them believe that the European Powers have had to submit to the Porte solely out of fear of the might of the Saltan. The Macedonian Question is keenly discussed and it is believed that the Sultan has determined once and for all to free the Ottoman Dominions of European interference. A few weeks ago the native villagers always need to salute Europeans here. Now they pass by without so doing and with a scowl. Europeans are continually being insulted, by the native youths, and yesterday, while going from my esbeh to the Delta Light Railway station, the cry against the Christians was raised at me by the village boys. They cried out, "Go on. yon Christians, we will see the matter through.” Their elders stood by and never attempted to correct them.</p>
<p>Reports of insults to Europeans are very frequent and I understand some Greeks close to Atfeh have been murdered. In Cairo and Alexandria the Europeans are safe, but in the villages the situation of the Christian population is very bad, for even if the moudirieh authorities had the will they would not have the requisite authority to put down any disturbance. I have noticed of late the significant increase in the amount of arms carried by the Bedouins. Youths belonging to that class of the population have of late began to go about with guns, while all the men are armed. As a matter of fact, I have seen boys about 8 years old with guns. The regulations as to bearing arms are laughed at and anybody can get back his gun from the police for a few piastres, for the police only make use of the rule that nobody but a ghaffir and the owner of an esbeh should be armed, to make a profit out of the inhabitants by seizing their guns for a few days and returning them on the payment of a small sum. The only way to overawe the people is to show them that the Army of Occupation is not a myth, and the G. 0. C. ought to order a route march at once through the villages. That would at least act as a temporary alleviation of the present unfortunate state of feeling.</p>
<head>FEAR OF RENEWED DISTURBANCE</head>
<p>It is commonly believed that there will be another disturbanoe on Sunday next, but this is very improbable, as the police have made numerous arrests among the disorderly elements of the population. On Sunday nearly 200 persons were arrested, and yesterday a similar number. Altogether up to midday to day fully 500 arrests had been made of persons who were known to have been con-cerned in the riot and of others who have used threatening language.</p>
<head>PRECAUTIONARY MEASURE.</head>
<p>As a precaution to prevent the arming of the populace the Alexandria City Police took measures to close all the shop of the gun smiths and dealers in weapons throughout the city. The demand for arms during the past fortnight has been very great, and both Europeans and natives have been purchasing revolvers, etc., in great numbers, so this step on the part of the police comes somewhat late in the day.</p>
<p>The date of the reopening of the gunsmiths’ shops has not yet been determined on, but they may be opened to-morrow if the authorities are sufficiently assured that the panic has subsided.</p>
<head>MR MARSDEN'S CONDITION.</head>
<p>Mr. Marsden, the sub-manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank, is still confined to his house owing to the injuries received by him from the mob on Sunday afternoon, but we are glad to be able to state that his wound is
progressing satisfactorily, and that he hopes to be quite convalescent in a few days’ time.</p>
<head>AN INCIDENT.</head>
<p>As an amusing instance of the extraordinary fear prevailing among a portion of the Europeans on Sunday we may mention that a number of Greek sailors threw themselves into the harbour in the afternoon in order to swim to their ships. As some of them were not good swimmers and became soon exhausted, they had to be rescued from a watery grave by natives.</p>
<head>THE SAMANOUD AFFAIR.</head>
<p>The originators of the unfortunate incident at Samanoud, about which such alarming and exaggerated reports were current have met with their deserts. Eight of the men have been condemned by the Mehallah Tribunal to ten months’ imprisonment each and eight to sixteen months' imprisonment</p>
<head>THE NATIVE PRESS.</head>
<p>The mildness of the observations of Musta-pha Pasha Kamel in "Al Lewa” is significant as in the judgement of many people it is considered that the articles of our Arabic contemporary have in a great measure contributed to inflame Moslem opinion. After briefly recounting the facts of Sunday’s riot he remarks:-- As regards this (the disturbance) we again request native and foreigners alike to avoid Any quarrel or dispute, because public relations can only improve by mutual harmony. Prudent people should be 'enjoined to urge upon the uneducated classes to abstain from any demonstrations.</p>
<p>“Al Moayad” says :-- Our readers will notice that Europeans attach great importance to small incidents that occur in Egypt and that is why any disturbance is called a riot. It is their lack of confidence in the natives that creates this fear in their minds. The Egyptians in general hoped that the Europeans, being in this country, would come to a good understanding with the natives, especially with the Moslems, for the Egyptians are all aware that no happiness or progress can be obtained except by peace and harmony. A party of the Europeans of Egypt, however, do not understand this fact or perhaps do not want to grasp its import.</p>
<p>The general impression is that the Government is in a great measure to be blamed for the present state of feeling, because it has allowed "Al Lewa” to excite the populace by fanatical articles, when it would have been a very simple matter to have checked all such abuse of the liberty of the Press.</p>

<head>A BOTANICAL CURIOSITY.</head>
<p>Members of the Alexandria Horticultural Society, and others who care for botanical curiosities and are unaquainted with the grotesque "Beard and Moustache Lily,” should take the present opportunity of inspecting the fine specimen of this plant to be seen in fall flower in the dep6t of Mr. Tramontina in
Rosetta-road.</p>
<p>It is a tropical, tuberous-rooted, perennial, native of Singapore and the Malay Peninsula, belonging to a small American, Asiatic, and Australian “genua” which has a botanical order all to itself—"Taccacese”—.</p>
<p>The name of the plant as given to it by the distinguished botanist Dr. William Jack, of the E. India Co., sixty years ago, is ’Tacca oristata,” but it is, generally, cultivated under the name of “Ataccia oristats ’’ It is easily reproduced from its numerous tubers, like the potato ; but it cannot be successfully cultivated in the open air in the climate of Alexandria."</p>
<p>The tubers of a closely allied species— “Tacca pinnatifida”—found all over the old world,tropics, and Polynesia, form an important item of the daily f ood of the inhabitants, like the * Qolcas” in Egypt (known in Polynesia as the “taro’’) ; but the "Tacca” has the advantage of being a valuable medicine in cases' of dysentery and diarrhoea. It is. known to the British in the Fiji islands, where it is largely cultivated as well as indigenous, under the name of ”South Sea arrowroot.”</p>

<head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
<p>The second representation of Fedora was given last night and proved another triumphant success. Once again we tender to Signa. Bellincioni our warmest congratulations on an altogether perfect performance Her superb ringing, seconded by consummate acting, is beyond praise, and leaves captions discrimination without a leg to stand upon. Such powers can only belong to a rara avis in the operatic world, of which fact none are more aware than the Alexandria audience, who, whilst her most moving passages wore in progress, were enthralled even to maintaining a strict silence; need we say more  Sig. Jose Palet was again in good voice, and his interpretation of the role of Loris left nothing to be desired. His singing is very true, his manner sympathetic, and he plays up well to Signa. Bellincioni. Signa. Alice Zeppilli and Sig. Giovanni Polese also-rendered valuable assistance. The orchestration was faithfully and delicately. carried out under Sig. Zuccani’s able baton. However, it is a well known saying that he “who praises" everything praises nothing," and we feel bound to steer clear of such an impeachment by remarking once more on the altogether disproportionate length of the entr’actes Surely it is no difficult matter to shorten these protracted waits end bring the duration at the performance within reasonable limits. In the present state of things, we might almost hazard an opinion, daring as it is, that people here go to the playhouse solely for the purpose of meeting their friends.</p>
