                    <p>THE EXTERMINATION OF THE MOSQUITO.</p>
                    <p>The articles and letters which have appeared recently in this journal under the above heading have given rise to much discussion as to the possibility of attempting in Egypt an organised crusade against the mosquito. That a really honest attempt to exterminate the mosquito and its attendant evils can be crowned with success has, as our correspondents point out, been demonstrated by experience in Singapore, Saigon, Salangor, Sierra Leone, New Orleans, and many other places. We would point out however, that although individuals may do much to protect their own homes and prevent them from becoming bleeding grounds for the larvae, to ensure success it is absolutely necessary to have the crusade carried out continuously and efficiently. It is not sufficient merely to kill the mosquitoes and their larvae one week and then neglect attending to their breeding haunts for another week.</p>
                    <p>Another one of the insect plagues of Egypt also might be considerably decreased-that of the common or garden house fly. Up the Nile especially, it is said that much of the ophthalmia is caused by these flies carrying infection from one to another. An expert entomologist might possibly be able to advise some method of dealing on a large scale with these pests. It has also often struck us as strange that in the large hotels in Egypt no attempt has been made to exclude insects by wire and netting and fine mesh screenings over windows and doors, the system adopted in America. Were this method carried out it would be possible to do away with mosquito nets for beds. That the present discussion has at least drawn attention to the possibility of combating the nuisance of the almost ubiquitous mosquito there is no doubt. Time, however, will show whether the carrying out of the destruction of the larvae on a wholesale scale will be attempted now or whether, like New Orleans, Egypt must wait until it is a choice between exterminating mosquitoes or the latter exterminating myriads of men.</p>
                    <p>It is unlikely, of course, that Egypt will ever be face to face with an epidemic of yellow fever, yet malaria we have always with us, and other diseases are known to be carried by the mosquito and the fly. It has been tritely said that we owe many diseases to their spreading by dirt, man, and the fly. The first we can remove, the second must remain, but in America they say "the fly must get." The climate of Egypt and the topography of the country lends itself to the successful accomplishment of at least ridding us in some measure of the mosquito. But as we stated above it is absolutely essential that the matter be not left entirely to individual or private enterprise, as the crusade to be effectual must be always at work. The organisation for each town must have the co-operation of the European community at least to have any means of success. Every house would have to be visited at least once a week until headway was made against the pest. All people interested would have to draw attention to the existence and persistence of mosquitoes in their locality. Wherever there was a fresh outbreak or recrudescence of the nuissance there would the vultures have to be gathered together. By swooping down on each place where mosquitoes were known to exist, in a very short time the numbers would be so enormously decreased as to convince the most pessimistic sanitary repressing neophyte that it was possible to do much to remove what is at present equally a menace to the health of the community as it is at all times a source of annoyance and discomfort.</p>

                    <p>Count von Bulow again asserted at length Germany's innocence of aggressive plans against England. He denied that Germany had ever been on the point of declaring war on Great Britain. The cause of the present crisis in the relations between the two countries is a mystery. Such stories as that of a violent collision between the Emperor and King Edward were idiotic lies. He vigorously attacked the Social-Democrats, whose constant representations of Germany as a disturbe of the peace have contributed to the present British mistrust of Germany.</p>	<p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <p>The imports into Egypt daring last month show a decline on those during the corresponding month of 1904. This decrease amounts to L.E. 477.784. But the total increase of imports for the eleven months of the year from January to November is LE. 1,049,916. Great Britain shared in the general falling-off of imports last month, importing only L.E. 557,164 worth of goods as against L.E. 829 858 for the previous November. But in the general increase of imports daring the eleven months Great Britain’s increased imports amount to L.E. 6,115,594, as against L.E. 6,045,234 for the same period in 1904.</p>
                    <p>More than half of the decrease in, imports for last month is due to the falling-off in textiles, which show a decrease of L.E. 267,365 on the corresponding month of last year.</p>

At one time there was actually a slight panic, a few families leaving for the Lebanon. The Porta's covert menace was. of course, calculated to cause some apprehension among the Christians, but what caused most fear was the massing of troops, estimated by some at 8 battalions, and the arrival of 3 batteries from Damascus. As a matter of fact the troops and guns are being sent to reinforce the dwindling numbers of the Yemen Army. The losses during the campaign have been terrible, some say as much as 50 %. An eye-witness tells me that on the troops landing from a recently arrived transport from the Yemen on the quay at Beyrout several fell dead, and their general aspect was one of ineffable misery.</p>

                    <head>PROTEST OF HELLENES.</head>
                    <p>The following is the text of a telegram which Mr. Emmanuel Benachi, President of the Hellenic Community of Alexandria, has despatched to Mr. Gennadis, the Hellenic Diplomatic Agent and Consul General at Cairo:—</p>

                    <p>The trial of the persons accused of having taken part in Sunday’s riot will begin at 8 o'clock to-morrow morning at the Native Court in Rosetta-street, Alexandria. The total number to be tried to-morrow is 104. The police have taken every precaution to avoid any disturbance in the neighbourhood of the Court and 40 policemen will be on duty there, besides a large number in reserve.</p>
                    <p>There are no grounds for believing that there will be any renewal of last Sunday’s disturbances tomorrow, but every precaution will be taken by the police in order to cops with any possible outbreak.</p>
                    <p>The state of the Corfiote Jew, whose head was smashed in by one of the mob in Saint Catherine's-square, is still very precarious. He is being attended to at the Jewish Hospital in Moharrem Bey.</p>

                    <head>ZIZINIA THEATRE.</head>
                    <p>We were well entertained, though not intensely overwhelmed by Samsone e Dalilah, as produced last night at this theatre. The delicate and sentimental handling, which Saint-Saëns’ magnum opus demands, can be found only in artistes of exceptional calibre and in minutely trained choruses, and, although last night’s caste was strong, it can hardly be said to have entirely met the exigencies of the case. Signa. Bianca Lavin carried out the arduous role of Dalilah in a melodious and very conscientious fashion. Her singing throughout Act II. was remarkably well sustained and was pleasantly distinguished by sensibility and refinement, most of her low tones being exquisite; at the same time there was occasionally a barely perceptible shortage in compassing the high notes. In all other respects she made a highly creditable Dalilah. Sig. Luigi Longobardi’s Samson was rendered with technical fluency and clear articulation, but he might with advantage have infused his part with more warmth and vigor. Sig. Pasquale Amato, as the Chief Priest and Sig. C. Nicolay who impersonated the aged Habrew, lent valuable and adequate support. Both are pos essors of rich, crisp voices. The part of Abimelech was rather stiffly rendered by Sig. Ricceri, who. is too apt to mouth his music. The chorus, on whom so much depends, gave a rather varied display. After singing in well with the overture, they became rather pre-cipitate after the rise of the curtain; moreover, the women's voices were too liable to fall into harsh, shrill tones. The men were decidedly better and showed feeling. A softer, if stolid, utterance was accorded to the graceful chorus of Philistine women. In Act III. a far more tasteful effect was obtained, all singing in very good harmony. The orchestra was again under Sig. Zuccani's skilful direction. Here at all events no exception whatever can be taken. They gave significant expression to the tender and refined music, which is too well known and too warmly esteemed to call for further dis-cussion in these columns. A word should be said for the ballets, which created a far better impression than Aida. Signa. A. Verganti's pas seul was very satisfactory and calls for little comment, but we wished we could have seen more of Signa. Bracchi, whose steps are extremely light and graceful. The production was well staged. All things considered, we are inclined to look upon the performance as very pleasing, but certainly not on a level with  those to which the present opera company have hitherto accustomed us, and it suffered consequently by the comparison.</p>

                    <head>THE CAIRO SEASON.</head>
                    <head>PROSPECTS FOR ’XMAS WEEK.</head>
                    <p>Many people an already installed in the Ghezireh Palace Hotel and enjoying its lovely
                        position and delightful gardens.—so welcome after the dusty streets of Cairo. On Wednesday the band of the King’s Royal Rifles was playing there from 4 to 6, and attracted many listeners. On other days a Tzigane orchestra provides music at frequent intervals. Sir Hugh and Lady Smiley have taken up their quarters here, and Mr. and Mrs. Rom, with their family, have moved on here from Shepheard’s. Mr. Astley Johnstone, who has already spent so many winters at Ghezireh, has again returned with his motor, and Mr. Curphy has also brought his motor. Colonel and Mrs. R Gordon are here, and Major Hessey, of the 2nd Inniskilling Fusiliers, and Mrs. Hessey are making the hotel their headquarters. Among other visitors are :—Comte and Comtesse Krassicki, Major, Mrs, and Miss Burney, Mr. and Miss Jones, Mr and Mrs. Honould, from Johannesburg, and Mr. C. Banbury, from India.</p>
                    <p>There will be a small dance at the hotel one evening in ’Xmas week, and several luncheon and dinner patties are being arranged for Sunday. Seeing its vicinity to the race-course, the hotel will be certain of much patronage on the occasion of the second meeting next week. On Shrove Tuesday, February 27, arrangements are being made for the big fancy-dress ball which has always been such a success in former years.</p>
                    <p>There will be 'Xmas trees at both Shepheard's and the Mena House Hotel on 'Xmas Eve, and as many grown-up’s as children are looking forward to that day. On ’Xmas evening there will be a gathering at the Hotel du Nil, when another tree will be in evidence.</p>
                    <p>Up to the present there have been but few social events to chronicle this season, but after this week we hope for better things. There is already “in the air” the expectation of ’Xmas, and if we cannot spend it in the old time honored English fashion, by our own fireside and among the children, we mean to do our best to celebrate the occasion.</p>
                    <p>There will be numerous small dances at the various hotels, and most people are making arrangements for cheery dinners at either one or the other.</p>
                    <p>Next week we have two days’(Wednesday and Friday) racing to anticipate at the Khedi vial Sporting Club at Ghezireh, and many ladies will take the opportunity of showing how well their pretty frocks become them It is rather unfortunate that Wednesday should also happen to be the day chosen for the marriage of Miss Nungovich to Capt. Wilson, R.A.M.C. So many friends have been bidden to the wedding and the reception to be held afterwards at the Savoy, that the first day’s raring will suffer by their absence.</p>

                    <head>AUTOMOBILES IN EGYPT.</head>
                    <p>The number of automobiles in Egypt ex ceeds 170, of which 110 are at Cairo and 56 at Alexandria, and the increase in this industry of recent years has given occasion for an interesting article in the Bulletin of the French Chamber of Commerce of Alexandria. A great drawback to the development of the industry is the lack of roads, especially the want of a great highway between Cairo and Alexandria. Our confrére remarks :—</p>
                    <p>Nous saisissons avec empressement cette circonstance pour joindre nos instances à celles qni s'élèvent un peu de toute part dans le but de demander au Gouvernement Egyptien la création d'une route carrossable d’Alexandrie au Caire, route qui serait une véritable artère vers lsquelle viendrait converger tout un réseau d’autres voies desservant les nombreux villages de l'intérieur. C’est ainsi que des communications faciles s’établi-ranent entre toutes les localités de l’Egypte au grand avantage du commerce et des transactions.</p>
                    <p>Certes, on ne peut invequer la pénurie du trésor ; peu d’Etats présentement une situation aussi florissante au point de vue des finances ; c'est ainsi que le projet de budget pour 1'an prochain, déduction faite de dégrèvemente dont le montant dépasse L.E. 300,000. accuse un excédent de recettes évalué à L.E. 500,000, somme dont l’emploi, jusqu'a présent, n'est pas déterminé. Tant au point de vue commercial qu'à celui de l’objet que nous traitons, nous apprendrions avec grand plaisir qu'une partie de cet excédent sera consacré à une oeuvre de si grande utilité et dont les conséquences écono-miques seraient incalculables pour la fortune du pays.</p>
                    <p>Nous verrions alors apparaltre les grosses voitures.de touristes, les 80-100 chevaux, avec lesquelles les 210 kilomètres qui séparent Alexandrie du Cairo seraient parcourus en une seule traite avec possibilité de retour dans la même journée.</p>
                    <p>Les amateurs, ayant devant eux de grands espaces à parcourir, deviendraient bien plus nombreux, et l'importation des automobiles en Egypte prendrait un grand développement.</p>
                    <p>The first automobile in Egypt was a little Dion Bouton, purchased by Prince Aziz about fifteen years ago. French motors are preferred, especially the following makes, de Dion Bouton, Peugeot, Renault, Panhard Levassor, Clément-Bayard. Charron-Girardot-Voigt, Darracq, Cot-terean. There are 43 motorcycles in Cairo and 17 in Alexandria. Motor omnibuses are being tried by the Cairo Omnibus Company, which has imported two of the Dietrich type and the trials are now being made.</p>

                    <head>EGYPT EXPLORATION FUND.</head>
                    <head>LECTURE BY MR HALL.</head>
                    <p>An interesting lecture was given yesterday afternoon at the Grand Continental Hotel, Cairo, by Mr. Hall of the British Museum under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Fund, of which Dr. Gerling Hayward is secretary in Egypt. The lecture dealt with a new XI. Dynasty temple discovered at Deir el'Bahri, and is the first of a series of four, one of which is to be given by Professor Naville and another by Dr. Grentell. After Capt Lyons had introduced Mr. Hall to his audience, the lecturer, with the aid of the magio-lantern, described the temple and its surroundings. After giving an interesting account of the great temple at Deir el Behri Thebes, he proceeded  to describe the new temple and showed how the pyramid above the royal tomb characteristic of the IV. Dynasty, with its small temple at the foot, had been superseded in XL Dynasty times by the temple, at some distance from the real tomb and acting as a sort of funeral chapel The new temple showed the last survival of the pyramid, a structure in the centre of the temple court with a base of about 60 feet square. He then described the various features of the temple, among them the tombs of ladies of the royal harem of King Neferkeprà of the XI dynasty, many of whom had been buried simultaneously before the completion of the temple, a fact that led certain Egyptologists to believe that they had been strangled after their lord’s death. The tomb of Neb-keper-rà with its 150 foot shaft next claimed attention, and then came illustrations of the most valuable find during the excavations. Among them was a magnificent alabaster head of the sacred cow of Hathor, a remarkable piece of realistic sculpture, its eye sockets still bearing traces of lapis lazuli. Then came the portrait statue of the grim-featured Usartesan III., the Se-sostris of the ancients, now in the Cairo Museum. The statue was found with five others, each representing the monarch at a different period of his life, on the S.-W. porch of the temple. The angular facial type wrongly supposed to be ’Hyksos’ appeared in the XII. and the latter half of the XI. Dynasty Pharaohs. Reliefs showed Bedouine of Sinai,yellow-skinned and hook-nosed, falling before the monarch's arrows, while the heads of Mentu-hotep, from his looks a relative of theUsertesens who established the XI.. Dynasty rule in Lower Egypt,andhis wife were most interesting. These kings, so said the lecturer, were certainly of Egyptian stock and their facial type could be recognised among the fellaheen of the present day. A relief on the royal sarcophagus showing a ferocious-looking fox dragging a half-fledged bird from its nest, a model combined bakery and brewery with its little life-like figures,which it was hoped would by some magical process come to life and bake and brew for his Majesty in the other world, were among the other discoveries and among the last but not the least interesting illustrations of the lecture was a photograph of a triangular piece of bread, solid and unappetising after more than 8,000 years, but retaining its smell of bread when first discovered. Other photographs showed the methods employed in digging and the men at work.</p>
                    <p>At 6.30 p.m. the lecture closed and Capt. Lyons paid Mr. Hall in the name of the audience a warm tribute of thanks.</p>
