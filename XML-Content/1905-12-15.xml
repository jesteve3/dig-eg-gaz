                    <head>M. LOREDAN'S PIANO RECITAL</head>
                    <p>A Cairo correspondent writes : — M. Pierre Loredan is, on the whole, to be congratulated on the success of his recital, for the odds were against him. He was provided with an exceedingly bad piano, the treble of which had no tone at all, and the attendance was sparse, and inclined to be talkative. I may mention as glaring examples of this vice three ladies in the sixth, row on the right and two ladies in the third row on the left (neither group English or French). who, by incessant conversation, did their best to draw public attention from the pianist to themselves. They could not have achieved this result by other means. I hope they will read these lines. The upper half of the programme was, as will be seen, of a very high standard ; but, like Nebuchadnezzar's  image, it degenerated into brass, iron, and common clay. M. Loredan has a fine technique, and shows to most advantage in the more complicated and difficult passages ; his touch is at times a little unsympathetic, but much may be excused one whose instrument is inexcusable. While his rendering of Beethoven left me cold, I cannot but admire most heartily 8carlatti’s Pastoral, as treated by him and the three choices from Chopin, though well worn, were hardly less enjoyable. The Sinding Printemps, a piece which should be reserved for great growing girls, was a failure, La Filense, pretty and delicately rendered. Il Tremolo is nothing more or leas than a cake-walk time, technically difficult but musically impossible; it is a pity that such fire works should be included in any programme. I trust M. Pierre Loredan will see his way to giving another recital under less adverse circumstances: so accomplished a pianist deserves more encouragement than he has, so far, met with.</p>

In fact, unless more money is forthcoming (they say) two nr three rooms must be left unfurnished. A further sum of £250 is required, and the oommittee feels justified, in view of the low figure at which the annual subscription has been fixed, in appealing to members for donations to the capital fund, and is confident that this appeal will meet with a generous response. Donations can be sent to the hon. sec., to tbe hon. treas., Mr. P. W. Carver, or to any member of the committee.</p>

                    <head>THE RECENT DISTURBANCES.</head>
                    <head>ATTITUDE OF NATIVES.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria has not been troubled by any fresh disorders, and the attitude of the native population is officially declared to be very tranquil.</p>
                    <p>The upper-class natives have expressed a keen desire to assist the authorities in preventing an outbreak on the part of the populace. Many of them have been voluntarily enrolled as special constables, and have under-taken that, if any outburst of disorder should break out in' their quarters of the city, they will exert themselves to the utmost to check it.</p>
                    <p>The Alexandria City Police have not discovered that the riot on Sunday is in any way to be attributed to premeditation. It is considered that had not the Greek shot the Arab no disturbance would have broken out on that day.</p>
                    <p>Every precaution has been taken by the authorities in case of a future outbreak.</p>
                    <p>All the gunsmith's shops still remain closed.</p>
                    <p>The Greeks who have been arrested in connection with the riot are local subjects and will therefore be dealt with by the Egyptian authorities.</p>
                    <p>The general opinion in official circles is that the Capitulations ware a powerful contributory cause, for  the natives recognise that there is one law for the Europeans and another for the Egyptians, and so wherever a native is injured there is always a predisposition for his compatriots to taka up his cause on the spot. Egyptians generally appear to regard the special privileges accorded to Europeans with a growing disfavor, which is often justifiable.</p>
                    <p>It is pointed out that the ferocity of the mob on Sunday has been much exaggerated by timorous Europeans, for, if the crowd had been as evilly disposed as has been made out, how is it that not a single European was killed outright during the disturbance?.</p>
                    <p>COMPENSATION CLAIMS.</p>
                    <p>The estimate of the damage done to the property of Hellenic subjects during the disturbance has been sent in to the authorities of the Alexandria Gouvernorat by M. Scotidis, the Hellenic Consul General. It amounts to £2,000.</p>
                    <p>The official valuation of the damages, which was undertaken by an engineer of the Alexandria Gouvernorat by order of the Parquet, amounts to the total sum of £50. The discrepancy is significant.</p>
                    <p>DEMONSTRATION STOPPED.</p>
                    <p>A number of Europeans had intended to organise a procession through the city on Sunday next, headed by a band, as a demonstration against the natives. As this would have been a most likely way to provoke another outburst the police authorities wisely decided not to allow such a foolish proceeding, and strict orders have been issued that no such procession is to take place. Any similar demonstration will also be prevented by the police in the interest of public security.</p>

                    <head>‘‘TOSCA” AT THE ZIZINIA</head>
                    <head>A SPLENDID PERFORMANCE.</head>
                    <p>In pronouncing last night’s performance of La Tosca as one of the best productions ever staged at this theatre, we believe we are
                        voicing the unanimous verdict of a warm and crowded house. The intense and harrowing pathos which pervades Sardon's drama and,
                        in sparcely less degree, Puccini's opera, was carried home to yesterday’s audience in a combination of rapturous music and tragic. acting, rising at its climax in the second act to heart-rending and tear-starting emotion. The first act was very well executed so far as the leading parts were concerned. Signa.Bellincioni, in the title ro1e. was in her best voice. The first solo of Sig. José Palest, as the artist Cava-radossi, and his subsequent duet with the diva, were cordially received, and with good reason. Sig. Giovanni Polese made at once a telling impression in his impersonation of Scarpia, the gentlemanly villain par excellence. Sig. G. E. Gianoli put in useful work as the Sagrestano. The boys’ chorus was too hurried and confused, but Sig. Zuccani eventually brought them well together.</p>
                    <p>To Act II. enough admiration cannot be given; suffice it to say that from beginning to end it was perfect Sig. Polese’s 8carpia was as active as it was dignified ; he used his voice with much fluency, keeping well within its limitations. Sig. Palet’s small share in this act was skilfully and fervently executed. But the honours, of course, go to Signa. Bellincioni, who, has seldom displayed the wealth of her resources to better advantage. Hsr sweet, flex-ible voice, her gracefulness. her striking beauty, and her magnificent dramatic powers must have stamped an indelible image on the memories of her many admirers, who were roused to tumultuous enthusiasm. The sustained and powerful passages with Scarpia. the charmingly plaintive solo, and the tragic finale were truly great moments than which we do not wish to see anything finer. 8mall wonder that the house rose at her and demanded calls innumerable, both of her, Sig. Polese, and Maestro Zuccani. Signa. Bellincioni followed up her triumph throughout Act III., and Sig. Palet's rendering of the famous aria marked a culminating point of excellence. Moreover, the orchestre in this, as in the preceding sets, showed a fine feeling of ensemble, so that the whole performance leaves ns in a spirit of gratitude with a "lively sense of pleasures to come."</p>

                    <head>MEMORIAL TO THE LATE M. TESTOUD.</head>
                    <p>It is a pleasure to us to record the kindly act of appreciative remembrance by which the old pupils of the School of Law have just sought to perpetuate the memory of their old Principal, M. Testoud. It appears that in response to a general feeling among the old students that some permanent memorial of the late Principal was desirable, a committee was formed and subscriptions were collected. It was decided that the memorial should take the form of a life-sized photograph, handsomely framed, to be offered to the Ministry for exhibition in the school. Tbe work hss been executed and was handed over to his Excellency , the Minister, yesterday by Omar Bey Lutfi, Abd El-Khalek Bey Sarwat, and Mo-hamed Bey Delavor, as delegates of the old scholars. His Excellency the Minister, in accepting the gift, expressed high appreciation of the motives which had prompted it, and has given orders for the portrait to be placed in the salle de reunion of the School.</p>
                    <p>The portrait is about life size and is a good likeness of the deceased jurist. It is mounted in a massive and handsome mahogany frame, fixed on an easel, the design and workmanship being extremely artistic and very creditable to its executant, Mohamed Saleh Suleiman. The frame and easel are mounted with arabesques in silver, and on the ledge of the easel is inscribed in silver fret-work the quotation from the Koran "Iuna hâzihi tazkirah” (this is a remembrance), together with the following verse of much merit specially composed for the purpose by Ahmed Bey Shanki, the Poet to his Highness the Khedive: -</p>
                    <p>Ashari antum,</p>
                    <p>Wa fadll ladelkum,</p>
                    <p>Wa ulumi ukurn,</p>
                    <p>The verse may be translated as follows:</p>
                    <p>You are my monument,</p>
