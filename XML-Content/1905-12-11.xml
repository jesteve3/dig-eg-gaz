                    <p>London, December 9.</p>
                    <p>Speaking at Oxford, Mr. Chamberlain said that nothing has taken place which in any way affects his personal relations and political connection with Mr. Balfour. He remarked that though the name of Home  Rule has been abandoned, the policy still remains the sarne, and that Home Role would be granted by instalments on the hire system. He strongly advised fiscal reform based on the imperialist view, aiming at the inclusion of the colonies in a single confederation, all the members of which would mutually support each other.</p> <p>(Reuter)</p>

                    <head>KHEDIVIAL OPERA HOUSE.</head>
                    <p>The Cairo theatre season opened at the Khedivial Opera House on Thursday with Pailleron's La Souris. It is, of course, early to pronounce on the merits of the company, but the repertoire promises well enough. La Souris, witty and clever, as is all Pailleron's work, was certainly an excellent beginning, and quite well interpreted. Mme Moreno, who has visited us again this year, was as welcome as ever, and deserved the applause she received : she had, naturally, the hardest part, supporting that side of the play which verges on the tragic ; and while her acting was most quiet and convincing, her voice and diction were a delight--a relief, we must confess, to the somewhat tapid and at times overload speech of her colleagues. The play is perhaps too natural in its reproduction on the stage of what all would understand from experience. M. Monteux was certainly good as Max. But judgment will be an easier matter after some more performances have been given. So far all seems well enough. Mme Moreno, at the conclusion of the play, recited ''Les trois Hussards, as well as the "Adieu Suzon" of Musset. In both her charm of diction and expression was shown to its full, and we may well look forward to and enjoy her appearance in sub-sequent plays.</p>
                    <p>L'Ami Friz and Le Passant were given on Friday. L'Ami Fritz is a comic opera pure and simple--without the music, as idyllic as can be, plenty of eating and drinking, pretty maidens, housekeepers, old and tried, marriage at the end, a relief in every way to the writer's other works : here was no snow, hunger, enemies, the trouble and endurance of war. It was very nicely staged and played, and such little subtleties of acting as appeared (shared by Fritz himself and his old Rabbi Councillor) were quite well brought out. The whole play has somehow a Teutonic flavour; it reminds one of the Verkaufte Braut (not that that is strictly speaking Teutonic) and other such ; and it is perhaps as good praise as need be to say that the actors all adapted themselves to it.</p>
                    <p>The short piece that followed--Le Passant of Francois Coppée--was in every way different, in its exquisite verse and dreamy Italian 'décor' : the diction and charm of voice of the two protagonists--rather the two performers--rendered the whole a gem. Mme Moréno we knew, but her companion Mlle Franquet fully kept up the harmony, and she has not perhaps the variety and clarity of tone which signalises Mme Moreno, but she has a most musical voice, and almost all through she avoids convention.</p>
                    <p>The staging was in every way admirable ; even Antoine himself might have approved it.</p>

                    <head>RIOT At ALEXANDRIA</head>
                    <head>POPULAR EXCITEMENT.</head>
                    <p>Alexandria was the scene of a somewhat serious disturbance yesterday afternoon,which, coming upon the rumours prevalent daring the past ten days, led to an extraordinary state of alarm and excitement among all classes of the population. There are various rumours as to the origin of the disturbance, but it appears that two Greeks were playing cards in a coffee-house at about 3.30 pm. in the rue de Malte,.which unites Sisters-Street with Anastasi street. They quarrelled during the game and one of the players drew his revolver and discharged its contents at his compatriot The man who was aimed at dodged,and the contents of one of the chambers of the revolver lodged in the body of an Arab, who happened to be near by, and who fell to the ground.</p>
                    <p>The Arabs in the neighborhood at once rushed on the Greek, who fled to a tobacconist's  shop, belonging to a Greek of the name of Vounapartopoulo, which was besieged and wrecked by the infuriated mob.</p>
                    <p>Fortunately the police came to the rescue of the Greeks,and with great difficulty and by the help of their bayonets succeeded in getting them to the Menshieh caracol.</p>
                    <p>TheHamamil quarter, where the disturbance broke out, is inhabited, in large part, by the lowest class of Europeans and natives. The former became panic-stricken and began to fire in the air from the roofs of the houses, which needlessly excited tbe natives. While this was going on in the Hamamil, huge crowds of Arabs came into the Mohamed Aly square, Saint Catherine's-square, Sister-Street, and all the neighboaring quarters. Many Europeans were attacked in the streets and the trams. The mob in the Mohamad Aly-square was more rowdy than vicious, and was composed of a number of youths. But the trouble in the Hamamil  quarter and Anastasi-street was more serious. The mob smashed the" chairs and tables in the open-air cafes in the square, while the masons at work on the large block now being built in the Post Office street began to hurl stones and building material on the people below. The mob obtained weapons by using the legs of the tables and chairs of the cafes aod battered any Europeans they came across.</p>
                    <p>The panic among the Europeans in the Square and its immediate neighbourhood was very great. A large number fled for refuge to Saint Catherine's Cathedral,and fainting women were borne to the Mixed Tribunals, where a number of Europeans were accommodated daring the disturbance. The guardian of the Tribunal disarmed a large number of the rioters.</p>
                    <p>We regret to state that among the victims of the mob's fury was Mr. Marsden, the sub manager of the Anglo-Egyptian Bank at Alexandria, whose ear was slit, but who was not dangerously wounded. Among other Europeans attacked was the  cashier of Messrs. Walker and Meimarachi. He was walking down Saint Mark's-street at the time, when a score of Arabs, armed with nabouts, rushed after him, crying "Death to the Christian" He was rescued in the nick of time by the bowab of Saint Mark's Building, who pushed him into the passage of the building.</p>
                    <p>One of our reporters, who was on the spot when the disturbance broke out, was attacked by the mob in Anastasi street, and he declares that the attitude of the mob in the Hamamil was very threatening. H.E. Mahmoud Pasha-Sidky, Governor of Alexandria, Miralai Hop-kinson Bey, Commandant of the Alexandria City Police, Bimbashi Cobbe, Sub-Commandant, and a number of mounted police hastened to the scene of the disturbance. The most effective means employed for calming the overheated passions of the populace were the hoses of the Alexandria. Fire Brigade, which played water upon the crowd with great force and succeeded in dispersing the mob in all directions.</p>
                    <p>The excitement spread from the square to other parts of the town and in the Attarin quarter hundreds of Berberin vagabonds rushed through the streets with nabouts.</p>
                    <p>Quiet was restored at about 5.30 o'clock, and the Mohamed Aly square presented its usual aspect in the evening. Most of the chairs and tables belonging to the coffeehouses that had been destroyed were removed and the damage visible was mainly limited to a little bro ken plate glass. The black marble plate of the Cassa di Soonta e di Risparmio was smashed to pieces, but on the whole little damage was done, for fortunately, being Sunday afternoon, the shops had their shutters up. The streets generally were very deserted during the evening, the number of persons about being few.</p>
                    <p>The Cafe de France in the Grand Square was attacked and greatly suffered at the hands of the mob. In Anastasi-street much glass and many lamps were smashed.</p>
                    <p>During the past few days the garrison at Fort Kom el-Dik had been reinforced, but for some unknown reason the fort was depleted of its additional troops on Saturday. Yesterday the fort's garrison was again reinforced.</p>
                    <p>The water supply of the city was to have been completely cut off by the Alexandria Water Company at 8.30 o'clook last night, but owing to the urgent representations of the Governor of Alexandria and the Commandant of Police it was decided to leave the water supply on in case any fires broke out, or it was found necessary again to use the hose on the populace.</p>
                    <p>About 250 members of the Alexandria City Polioe were employed in quelling the rioting, and they effected the arrest of 160 natives. Most conflicting accounts are given as to the
                        attitude of the police during the riot. It is stated that the police did not show any real determination at the beginning of the trouble, and only began to exert themselves when the chief officers arrived. An eye-witness says:-- I was in my house in Anastasi-street yesterday when I saw two policemen taking a European away. The police were followed by two other officers with drawn swords. The European was not protected in front by the police and the natives threw stones at him and hit his face with sticks until it was a bleeding indisting-uishable mass of flesh. Another European was brought along by the police and treated in the same way by the populace.</p>
                    <p>THE SCENE IN THE SQUARE.</p>
                    <p>"An Eye-witness" writes:--I witnessed from the upper story of a house on the square the disturbance which took place there this afternoon, and it may interest you to know what I saw. I may preface- my remarks by saying that, near the same spot, I'saw the massacre in June, 1882. I was also in Turkey during the massacres in 1896. I do not therefore think that I am likely, to be unduly impressed by what I saw to-day. I was reading in my room when, abont a quarter past four o'clock, I beard an unusual noise in the street. Thinking -that a serious accident had happened, I went to the windows of my rooms and, to my great surprise, I saw a great crowd of persons, both natives and Europeans, rushing frantioally in all directions, as' though they were being panned. I remarked that many of the Arabs were carrying rough pieces of wood in their hands, sufficiently large to inflict an ugly wound, if used as a weapon; other Arabs were busy trying to break up chairs which evidently ban been stolen from a cafe near. The object of breaking up the chairs was evidently to provide a supply of bludgeons. Some of the Arabs broke the chairs by striking them against the stone roadway; others placed chairs before the passing trams, possibly with the idea of stopping tbe trams. In any case, it was evident they meant mischief. The spectacle was identical with that which I saw in 1882 and, as there was an ugly crowd of some thousands of persons at the, bottom of the Place, with which the police was evidently unable to cope, tbe situation seemed a serions one. This crowd appeared to be one solid compact mass, and it was only after the arrival	of the fire engines
                        that it was, dispersed into the side streets and shortly after quiet was restored. I should say that the mob was not organised, but it was evident that a row of some sort was looked for, as I remarked that, as was the case in 1882, the Berberin were much in evidence, some came on foot, in groups of three or four, others by the trams. They ware evidently on the qui vive. Now we shall possibly be told, by those who are responsible for the maintenance of order in this city, 'that the gamins and shoeblacks were only having a big lark ; that the whole thing was in itself unimportant, and that those who took the thing seriously are poor timid creatures who are easily alarmed.
                        I am not easily alarmed and my longexp-rienoe of the elements composing the population of this city warrants me in saying that a vary grave danger existed and still exists. It is notorious that, for weeks past, both Christians and natives have been busily occupied in pro-ouring arms. No one seems exactly to know why, but natives and Christians alike are nervously awaiting for something to happen. This in itself is a danger and some mens should be taken to demonstrate that the responsible European authorities,for they alone\ can be relied on, dispose of the means necessary to maintain order. It proof ware wanting of the utter uselessness in case of emergency of the police, as it is at present organised, this shoe-black demonstration gave it Their efforts (?) to restore order were absolutely grotesque, so far as I saw. A set of special c onstates would have known better what to do.1 Many were the enquiries as to the whereabouts , of the armée d'occupation. Some said it would only appear if there was shooting to be done, others said that t he authorities were afraid to send troops into the town lest people should get alarmed and visitors he deterred from coming to Egypt All were agreed that it was better to be even more alarmed than they already were than risk a broken bead. Seriously, it is time that some energetic measures were taken to reassure the public, which possibly, though I dont think so, may be needlessly alarmed.</p>

                    <head>ON THE BOURSE.</head>
                    <p>This morning some timorous brokers sent off telegrams to London stating that a riot had taken place and that all settlements were to be kept in suspense until the situation was clear. Some prominent Alexandria stock brokers, on hearing of this, at once telegraphed to the London Stock Exchange Committee to the effect that everything was calm and that that settlements were going on as usual. This had a quieting effect and the market has been very firm all round a large number of transactions taking place.</p>
                    <p>At the time of the disturbances, about 5.30 o'clock, when the police had cleared the people from the Frank-street end of Mohamed Aly-square the backwash of the rioters (e.g., bootblacks and other rowdy youths) were driven by the mounted polioe towards Cherif Pasha-street. There was a large crowd, standing anxiously watching the scene from the peristyle  of the Bourse. When the rabble came up to the neighbourhood of tbe Bourse all these spectators of the fray, huddled up together, seized chairs, decanters aod glasses and with shouts of determination decided to sell their lives dearly. Ore prominent-brokerstanding  there boldly exclaimed "Defendiamooi fino al l'ultimo." He then brandished a chair over his head and retired into the interior of the Bonne. His comrades remained on the peristyle  but none of them were hurt as none of the rioters ever got rear them.</p>

                    <head>THE SUCRERIES</head>
                    <head>SETTLEMENT PENDING.</head>
                    <p>We understand that a conclusion of the negotiations  as to a settlement equitable alike to the creditors end bondholders has almost been reached, and that definite news may be expected et any moment.</p>
                    <p>The fourth meeting of the creditors of the Sucreries took place on Saturday afternoon under the presidency of Judge Took. Proceedings opened shortly after 3 p.m., when the judge asked Ma Carton de Wiart whether he was able to put any definite proposals before the meeting. Me. Carton de Wiart replied (that be was still unable to do so, but that the negotiations were nearing a settlement. In reply to another question on the part of the President, he stated that proposals now being considered differed from those previously made in that the bondholders, instead of receiving a fixed interest, would be paid a reduced interest guaranteed by a syndicate but would retain their previous position as bondholders. The pourparlers were going steadily forward and there was a possibility that holders of obligations would be repaid at par or 25% premium. He therefore asked for a week's postponement.</p> <p>The President replied that since the 19th September matters had remained in stats quo and he would therefore grant not a week but a fortnight--for positively the last time--but if matters should then have made no progress the situation of the Sucreries would have to be put before the Courts.</p>
                    <p>Me. Carton de Wiart expressed his readiness to satisfy the President, end then came another development M. Dienzeda, a workman under the company, who had been injured in an accident, had been a year in the French hospital and had never seen his pay since December 5, 1904. Me. Martino spoke on his behalf and touched on the Cronier bills, asking whether the bills had been given to cover the current accounts that M. Cronier may have had in different banks, whether those produced were renewals or had they been regularly discounted since the date of their endorsement, and in that case what was the rate of discount?</p>
                    <p>Me. Carton de Wiart replied that the causes of M. Drenzede's accident were uncertain; as far as his pay went the company was ready-to pay after verification of the claim Me. Padoa Bey remarked that the Martino clients had no right re intervene for the discussion of the validity of the claims put in by the creditors : which led the President to observe that creditors and shareholders were alike interested in bills representing 20,000,COO frs.</p> <p>More explanations and discussions followed. The Oases of M. Dienzde and of M. Mariotti, an employe in a like condition, were to go before the  competent court, so Judge Jack decided, and after Professor Sampaolo had handed into Court a number of verifications, proceedings closed till the next and positively the last meeting.</p>

                    <head>RUINS OF ANCIENT EGYPTIAN CITY.</head>
                    <head>EXCAVATIONS HAVE MADE POSSIBLE AN ACCURATE PICTURE of El Amarna.</head>
                    <head>HISTORY OF ITS FOUNDING</head>
                    <p>Twelve years ago, on a lovely spring morning, I was walking along the east bank of the Nile, near to the village of Hadji Qandil some 180 miles above Cairo. The land around was a wide amphitheatre of sand some twelve miles across, shut in by the Arabian hills, and almost, except near the river, an arid expanse of sand. There was an awakening of life ; pigeons rose from the beanfields in hundreds and a belated gazelle stole up from the watering place and made swiftly for the hills. Lumbering buffaloes were being fastened to the water wheels, and the women were around the wells. Away from the river all was still and silent. Once, however, that sandy plain was all alive with busy men and women. Where low heaps of sand break the monotony of the plain there once stood a splendid temple and a royal palace, while the houses of priests and officials, together with shops and bazaars, formed a busy city. Though little remains of this once beautiful place there are, fortunately, preserved monuments by which we are enabled to reconstruct the town and the life of the king and its people in a wonderful manner. The Arabian hills form the wall of this circus, and the sides of these are the site of many splendid tombs of the city officials. It is no ordinary city we have to deal with ; unique in its origin, history and religion. It forms the record of a remarkable episode in Oriental history and the memorial of the dominant will and power of one of the most astonishing women of the East.</p>
                    <p>ORIGIN OF THE CITY.</p>
                    <p>The recovery and publication of the material from which to restore the picture is due to the work of Mr. N. de G. Davies, who has for many months been engaged in copying the sculptures and inscriptions in these great tombs, which have now been published by the Egypt Exploration Fund. Before describing these splendid sculptures a word must be said as to the origin of this city. Amenophis III. (B. C. 1500) had during his reign married a member of Asiatic wives, among them being Tii, apparently a princess of Mitanni or northern Mesopotamia.</p>
                    <p>The foreign element in the Theban royal harem became so powerful that a religious revolution broke out, and an attempt, for a time successful, was made to replace the great worship of Amen Ra, king of the gods, by that of the Aten, or “Solar Disk.’’ For a time only was it powerful in Thebes, and on the accession of the youthful ruler Amenophis IV , who was rigidly under the control of his imperious mother, the position became so serious that the king and court removed from Thebes to a new city which was built upon this plain of El Amarna. The idea of this abandonment of the southern capital originated with the queen mother, and that she took an active part in the work is shown by her name being inscribed, with all her titles, upon the central pillar of the great quarry from which the stone for the royal and sacred edifices was obtained.</p>
                    <p>The priest of the tombs was that Mery-Ra who was the high priest of the Atendisk in the city of Akh Aten, ''The glory of the disk.” He was also “fan bearer on the king’s right hand," “royal chancellor,’’ “A sole companion or privy councillor.” On entering the stately portion of the tomb and passing into the columned entrance hall, we see at once we have a quite different class of burial place to those which are found near Thebes. The tombs of Mery R of Paneshey are, we find on entering, veritable rock-cut mansions consisting of several stately halls and chambers. Still more marked is the difference in the lavish mural decorations. The walls are not covered with weird scenes from the Books of the Dead or the underworld, nor do they depict scenes in the domestic life of the departed. Each tomb, from its decorations might be a royal tomb. The king and his family dominate everything. As Mr. Davies remarks : "His wife and children, his family affection, are here portrayed in detail,” and it is difficult to discover the official whose tomb it is.</p>
                    <p>In the tomb of Mery-Ra we have a picture of the house where the king visits him, and it must have been a beautiful abode. Before the entrance was a large tank, surrounded by trees. There are many courts and cool colonnades, while a picturesque garden full of flowers and shady trees, and another large tank, beside which the owner and his family might enjoy the pleasures of home life in the evenings. In the tomb of Paneshi we have a representation of the temple of the Aten, and full details of the service. It differs from the Theban temple in many respects.</p>
                    <p>THE ROYAL FAMILY.</p>
                    <p>The offerings were fruit and flowers ; oxen were led to the temple wreathed and decorated with flowers, and the king and the queen and the young princesses came to worship, bringing offerings of flowers, incense and sweet smelling gums. Indeed, it is remarkable how great a part the beauties of nature form in the temple service. The most striking feature, however of these tableaux is the freedom of life, and the way in which the royal family mingled with the people. Seated on the balcony of the palace we see the king with his arm round the neck of the queen throwing down presents of collars and ornaments to the crowd below, or often holding the hand of one of the little princesses and throwing bunches of flowers to the children in the street. One group of dancing children in pleated skirts seems almost modern in its realism.
                        Very touching is one scene depicting a choir of blind men performing before the king. Led by a harper and a leader who keeps time by clapping his hands, these poor sightless men seem to be singing the praises of the bright god of light, whose rays they cannot see. The execution of the work is wonderful, considering its antiquity. In other sculptures we see the king and queen driving across the plain in their chariots, preceded by running footmen.</p>
                    <p>Throughout the whole of this gallery of ancient pictures we strike no sad note. The shadow of death, ever present in the tombs of the Memphic and Theban age, is banished ; all is love and joy and pleasure of life. The period is a unique one in ancient history, and finds its modern parallel in the life of the French court at Versailles. But the life was a short one. The king died and was buried in a great tomb in the hills, and there was no direct heir to the throne. During this life of pleasure the affairs of State had been neglected, the great conquests in Syria and in Nubia were slipping from the hands of this effeminate Pharaoh, and it was not until the Theban power once more regained its supremacy that Egypt became the ruler of the ancient world. Still, however, the epoch is full of matter  of interest to the historian and the archaeologist, and these beautiful reproductions will long form the standard authority upon so interesting an episode in the ever changing panorama of Egyptian history. With the fall of the heretic line the city was abandoned, and the sand of the desert spread its veil over this ancient city of beauty and pleasure.	</p>

                        <p>To THE Editor OF THE Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                        <p>Dear Sir,—I noted the forecast you made of the new Liberal Cabinet. I am glad to see by to-day's news that you are likely to be wrong. Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman is keeping the men of the stamp of Lord Rosebery, Sir Edward Grey, Mr. Asquith, and the like out of his Cabinet. The last-named is especially odious to the Labour party, among whom he is known as “butcher Asquith,” and Sir Henry cannot dispense with the aid of the Labour members, who are likely to be more numerous in the next Parliament. It would be wisest in my opinion for Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman to make a composite Cabinet of Liberals—earnest and thorough, not weak-kneed like the three above-named—Labour members, and a sprinkling of Irish Home Rulers. These last would participate, I believe, if Irish Home Rule is placed in the foremost rank in the programme. The Cabinet would then be for the first time in English history one composed of all classes in the United Kingdom, not limited as heretofore to one class and excluding men who represent Irish ideas and sentiments. With a Cabinet like that, the new Premier can face the Elections with a sure hope of an overwhelming victory. He will then be able to deal boldly and fearlessly—as he expressed it at Stirling—with every social problem, and if the House of Lords try their tactics of obstruction they will do so at their peril.—Yours truly, 	J. Amigo.</p>

                    <p>To the Editor of the Egyptian Gazette.</p>
                    <p>Sir,—It is sincerely to be hoped that the sensible suggestions contained in Mr. Thorwald Smith’s letter in yesterday’s ( Thursday ) “Egyptian Gazette” will be acted up to by the proper authorities, for there is no doubt that the death rate of Egypt is largely due to these moat pestiferous creatures. The success of the authorities at New Orleans in fighting the epidemic of yellow fever now prevailing in that city illustrates forcibly the old and new methods of controlling this scourge. In the country we have the old-fashioned "shot-gun" quarantine in full operation, but in the city the latest methods of sanitary science are taught and enforced. On the former we read Such reports as the following: —“The Governor has directed the Commander of the State Guard to detail as many men as might be necessary to act as guards on all trains entering the State and at all points where boats run in order to establish a strict trade quarantine against all points where yellow fever is found to exist.” It is reported that the State of Mississippi has five armed boats patrolling the coast to prevent fishermen breaking through the quarantine lines, and armed guards patrol the lines of railroads entering the State. On the other hand the health officer of New Orleans has issued the following sensible advice and information “The spread of yellow fever is easily controlled by the application of very simple rules. Whether or not New Orleans will be rid of yellow fever at an early date depends in a very large measure on the degree of assistance each householder is willing to contribute to the work of eradication. Yellow fever is transmitted by the bite of a mosquito whose breeding places are cisterns, water barrels, and similar collections of water. The mosquito bites in the daytime usually, and in order to become infectious must bite a patient daring the first three days of the fever, and then ten days must elapse before it is capable of transmitting the disease. Mosquitoes are not dangerous after the third day of the fever. Therefore protect from mosquitoes, day and night, all cases of fever for three days and then destroy before the tenth day after the beginning of the illness the mosquitoes that are in the room." The mayor has issued a proclamation, approved by the State Board and the United States Public Health Service which requires all citizens to allow no stagnant water on their premises ; to screen all cisterns after treating the surface with oil; to place oil in cesspools and privy vaults ; to sleep under nets; and to screen doors and windows. The Egyptian Sanitary Department ought to issue similar instructions, for not one in a thousand of the people know how dangerous the mosquito is to health.—I am. etc,</p>
